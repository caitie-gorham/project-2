## Description
Have you ever considered purchasing a plant for your home but don't know where to start? What the best starter plants are, what the best fit for your house may be or for your schedule? Welcome to HomeGrown! HomeGrown is a house plant based application that helps new plant owners learn about the top house plants and their basic needs. Once a new user signs up for the HomeGrown site they are logged in. The Common Houseplants page offers basic information on the top 15 house plants. Their scientific names, sunlight care schedule, as well as watering tips. A "My Greenhouse" page offers a space where users can save plants that they are interested in purchasing as well as a space to write information that may be beneficial later to the user.

## Goal
The goal of our application is to make the lives of new plant owners easy. When a user signs up for the HomeGrown website, they are automatically logged into the site. The user then accesses the "Common Houseplants" page which offers basic information about the top 15 house plants. Once the user finds a plant they are interested in they are given the option to save a plant to their "Greenhouse".

## Challenges and Successes
Our primary challenge was using the many-to-many association to join our plants data and our users data. We were successful in setting up a framework for our application, designing a cohesive application, and creating and serving our seeds data.
